(see class in archy)

- all player witches must be in the Wild witch or Emperor's coven so they can do all magic.
- no humans except Luz and the player in BI.
- all witches have a coven (Wild, Emperor's, Abominations, Bard, Beast Keeping, Construction, Healing, Illusions, Oracle, Plant, Potions)
- humans will be placed into the Glyph coven and demons into the Demon coven.

covens:
	Wild coven- also known as the "Bad Girl coven".
	Despite leading it Eda is actually a part of the glyph coven because of her curse.
	(this is an important distinction to note as being a part of a coven in code is different than in lore because the glyph coven and demon coven aren't 'real')

[Tutorial is the Convention and/or the first day of school.
The tutorial will teach you the basics of all species/covens but also gives a more in-depth explanation depending on what species you are and what coven you pick.]
